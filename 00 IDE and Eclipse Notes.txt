==============================================================

1) What is an IDE?
	- IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment
	- An editor software that provides an evironment to develop projects by integrating to different softwares is called IDE
	- That means IDE provides connectivity to different sotwares from the same editor window.
	- we no need to open each software in separate window those we are using in our project

2) What are the advantages of IDEs?
	1) it gives code help (less typing, more choosing)
	2) automatic importing packages
	3) auto generation of code (fields, constructors, methods, condition, loops, try, catch, finally, throws, etc...)
	4) easy debugging
	5) we can connect to diff sotware from this IDE editor
	6) fast development

3) Popular IDEs for Java application development?
	1) Eclipse
	2) STS
	3) IntelliJ
	4) NetBeans
	
4) Working with Eclipse?
	1) What is eclipse?
		- An eclipse is an IDE
		- It is an editor software
		- It is an open source software(freely avilable to download, we can also involve in its development eclipse features)
		- It is meant for developing project more fast with less typing

	2) Why Eclipse?
		- for fast develop with ease and less efforts

	3) How to install eclipse?
		1) download eclipse from "eclipse.org/downloads"
		2) click on "Download Packages" 
		3) click "Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers"
		4) click "Windows x86_64"
		5) you will find "eclipse.zip" file is downloaded into your system
		6) extract it to "C:\" drive by using winrar software
	
	4) How to start eclipse?
		1) go to eclipse installed folder "C:\eclipse"
		2) double click "eclipse.exe" file
		3) select workspace 
		4) click "Launch" button 
		5) eclipse is started and welcome page is opened

			Note: 
			- A Workspace is a folder where you want to store projects.
			- To identify a folder as workspace, eclipse creates a directory with the name ".metadata".
			- In this folder eclipse stores all plugins and the setups we are doing for this workspace.
				Note: do not delete this folder, it is not virus
				- If you delete this folder, eclipse can not recognize your folder as workspace
				- All setups and projects you created earlier are not loaded into eclipse

	5) Creating project
		- click "create project"
		- click "Java project" -> Next
		- Enter project name: 15 Encapulation
		- click Next -> Finish -> Donot create
		- click Open Java Project perspective
		
		Note: a new project is created with the name "15 Encapuslation"
		- verify its structure in the workspace folder
		- you will find
			1) src folder			-> contains .java files those we are creating from eclipse
			2) bin folder			-> contains .class files those are compiled from .java files

			3) .settings folder		-> contains the setting we did for this project
			4) .classpath file		-> contins the jars information those attached to this poject
			5) .project file			-> contins information above this project to load when eclipse is started

			Note: if we delete any of above folders or files your project will not work from eclipse

	6) Changing font
		1) for just increasing and decreasing font size 
			- press ctrl ++  and ctrt + --
		
		2) for changing font name, font style and font size
			- click window menu

			- double click basic -> scroll down -> select Text font 
			- click Edit button -> select the font name, font style, font size
			- click "Apply and close" button

	6) Developing a class in eclipse?
		1) Create a Java project with the name "15 Encapsulation" as show in above step
		2) Create a class
			1) right click on src folder
			2) click "class"
			3) enter class name: Test 
			4) click main method chck box
			5) click finsh
			7) add System.out.println("Hi"); in main method
			
	7) Compiling and running a class from eclipse
		1) In eclipse every class is auto compiled and saved in bin folder
		2) We no need to compile but we must execute
		3) We have 4 options to run java class in eclipse
			1) By using "Run button" available in images bar
			2) Right click on editor any where -> click "Run As" -> click "Java Application"
			3) In package explore view -> Right click on .java file -> click "Run As" -> click "Java Application"
			4) Short cut -> press (Ctrl + F11)
		

	8) eclipse short cuts for fast development
		1) for code drop down					--> ctrL + space
		2) for filteing code in drop down			--> (type some text) and press (ctrl + space)
		3) for adding main method				--> type main  then press (ctrl + space)	

		4) for adding System.out.println()			--> sysout/sys/syso/sout + (ctrl + space)
		5) for adding System.out.println("trace")	--> systrace/sys/syst/strace + (ctrl + space)
		6) for adding System.err.println();			--> syserr/sys/syse/serr + (ctrl + space)
